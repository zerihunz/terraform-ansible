ARM - Azure Resource manager

Create the resource group with Azure CLI

az group create --name myResourceGroup --location "East US"

To deploy the template, use either Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell. Use the resource group you created. 
Give a name to the deployment so you can easily identify it in the deployment history.  

az deployment group create --name blanktemplate --resource-group armResourceGroup --template-file .\azuredeploy.json

Next Add a storage account to the resource group

armResourceGroup

The storage account name must be unique across Azure. The name must have only lowercase letters or numbers. It can be no longer than 24 characters. You might try a naming pattern like using store1 as a prefix and then adding your initials and today's date. For example, the name you use could look like store1abc09092019.
