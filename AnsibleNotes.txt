- pip3 install ansible   //use python3, hence pip3, python 2 is depreciated by now.
- ansible is owned by redhat
- Ansible is agentless - meaning that all connections are done over the standard remote-access services that you already have configuration for. 
                         Ansible can start managing remote machines immediately, without any agent software installed.

- By operating in an agentless manner over SSH and WinRM, Ansible avoids this problem -- 

- Ansible is Free

- AnsibleTower is paid version

- Ansible is a push model

- Ansible is a simple IT Automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration,
  and many other IT needs.

- Ansible is made with Python, shell script and Ruby

Ansible can manage Physical devices:
    - Bare metal servers - cobbler, stacki and red hat satellite
    - Network devices - Cisco, Juniper, Arista.
    - Storage devices - NetApp, Infinidat, Pure Storage, IBM Storage, Dell EMC, HPE OneView
    - Servers - HP Enterprise
Ansible supports all leading virtualization platforms:
    - VMWare
    - Red hat virtualization (RHV)
    - Xenserver
    - Vagrant
Ansible supports these Operating systems
    -  Linux, including: RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, ubuntu, and others
    -  Windows and Windows Server, UNIX, OSX, IBM z/OS, NGINX
    -  IBM Power Systems      



//To show Linux operating system names
cat /etc/os-release
lsb_release -a
hostnamectl
Type the following command to find Linux kernel version:
uname -r


To add key to ssh agent in linux, do the following:

 ssh-agent bash
 cp ec2-key.pem ~/.ssh/
 sudo cp ec2-key.pem ~/.ssh/
 ssh-add ~/.ssh/ec2-key.pem

 ansible ansible-target-1 -m ping -i inventory.txt

 To Avoid host key checking on every run of the above command, run the following command

 export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False

 or

 edit the file: /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg and uncomment "host_key_checking = false" line

 instead of specifying "ansible-target-1" in the above command, you can specify a tag, [servers] at the top
 and name servers to ping both servers.

 <- yaml supports comments, json does not
# did you know you can embed json in yaml?


 {
   "raw_materials":[
     "Coffee",
     "Flavour Liquid",
     "Milk",
     "Water",
     "Sugar"
   ]
 }

 YAML multiline strings:
 - Use > most of the time: interior line breaks are stripped out, although you get one at the end:
 - Use | if you want those linebreaks to be preserved as \n (for instance, embedded markdown with paragraphs).

 comments in YAML are precedded with #

 expressions in YAML:   file_path: "{variable}"

Ansible Module
- modules (also known as "task plugins" or "library plugin") are discrete units of code that can be used from the command line or in a playbook task
- Ansible executes each module on the remote target node, collects returned values

ansible <pattern_goes_here> -m <module_name> -a <arguments>
ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=restarted"

-A pattern is a set of groups (sets of hosts) - in the above case machines in the "webservers" group
