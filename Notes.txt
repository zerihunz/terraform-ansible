-Terraform destroy command destroys everything in the infrastructure. This command is not recommended in prod environment.
-VPC - Virtual Private Cloud  
-Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) gives you complete control over your virtual networking environment, 
    including resource placement, connectivity, and security. The first step is to create your VPC. 
    Then you can add resources to it, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and 
    Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances. Finally, you can define how your VPCs communicate with each other 
    across accounts, Availability Zones (AZs), or Regions.
-Terraform.tfstate file is absolutely crucial to the functioning of Terraform. Don't mess around with this file.

-Advanced project plan 
    1.Create VPC
    2.Create Internet Gateway
    3.Create Custom Route Table (optional but cool to look at)
    4.Create a Subnet where our webserver is going to reside on
    5.Associate subnet with Route Table
    6.Create security group to allow port 22(SSH), 80(http), 443 (https)
    7.Create a network interface with an ip in the subnet that was created in step 4
    8.Assign an elastic IP to the network interface created in step 7 (Elastic IP is a public IP that's routable on the internet)
    9.Create ubuntu server and install/enable apache2

- When you make a key pair, use pem if you're a linux or mac user, use ppk if you're windows putty user.    

- In a home or small office environment, the default gateway is a device, such as a DSL router or cable router, 
  that connects the local network to the Internet. ... A device wishing to communicate with a host on the public Internet, 
  for example, forwards the packet to the default gateway for its network segment.

- In routing tables, 0.0.0.0 can appear in the gateway column. This indicates that the gateway to reach the corresponding 
  destination subnet is unspecified. This generally means that no intermediate routing hops are necessary because the system is 
  directly connected to the destination.  

- Egress in the world of networking implies traffic that exits an entity or a network boundary, while Ingress is traffic that 
  enters the boundary of a network.  

- Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block basically is a method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing. 
  When you create a network or route table, you need to specify what range are you working in. 
  "0.0.0.0" means that it will match to any IP address. Some IP addresses are specific, like 10.0.0.0  
  which will match to any IP address beginning with 10.

- NOTE: Some of the IP address in a range are reserved for various purposes. According to AWS VPC documentation, 
 following are the reserved IP addresses.
    10.0.0.0: Network address.
    10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
    10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS. The IP address of the DNS server is always the base of the VPC network range plus two; however, we also reserve the base of each subnet range plus two. For VPCs with multiple CIDR blocks, the IP address of the DNS server is located in the primary CIDR. For more information, see Amazon DNS Server.
    10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.
    10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address. We do not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore we reserve this address.  


-To destroy terrafrom so that you won't be billed:    terraform destroy --auto-approve

-The command "terraform state list" lists all of the resources that we have created a state for.

-And to see more about the items listed do this command: "terraform state show aws_eip.one"

-terraform refresh would show ouput blocks without applying or potentially modifying anything.

-"terraform destroy -target aws_instance.web-server-instance"  //destroys only the webserver

-"terraform apply -target aws_instance.web-server-instance"  //applys only the webserver

- a variable can be passed after "terraform apply" or

- a variable can also be passed from the command line like: "terraform apply -var "subnet_prefix=10.0.100.0/24"

- best way to use is to use a separate file for variable assignment

- If nothing is provided provided, terraform can use a default, which is specified under the variable declaration block

- It is also possible to use objects in terraform.tfvars file:
    subnet_prefix = [{ cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24", name = "prod_subnet" }, { cidr_block = "10.0.2.0/24", name = "dev_subnet" }]
