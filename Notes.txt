VPC - Virtual Private Cloud  
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) gives you complete control over your virtual networking environment, 
including resource placement, connectivity, and security. The first step is to create your VPC. 
Then you can add resources to it, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and 
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances. Finally, you can define how your VPCs communicate with each other 
across accounts, Availability Zones (AZs), or Regions.
